1. After clone the project to your local platform, create a folder names "data"
2. The gold standard and training data can be found in data.zip
3. unzip data.zip and put the gold standard sets and training data sets to the created data file



The input data sets are too large so they cannot be uploaded to this repository. I will share you a google drive folder and share access with you. This file names "input.zip" in the folder Final_Submit of Google Drive
